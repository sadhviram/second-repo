The UK will bask in warm sunshine this week as a mini-heatwave will send temperatures up to 25C - but the Met Office has warned of the looming prospect of thunderstorms in the weekend.

Clear and dry weather will be enjoyed by the vast majority of Brits as an area of high pressure moves in from the west, bringing with it above-average temperatures across the country for autumn the Met Office said.

South and southeast England will see highs of 23 to 25C over the next five days, as temperatures sit in the high teens and low-to-mid twenties across the UK.

But as the week moves on and the area of high pressure shifts towards the east, there may be some “showers across the southern half of the country, on Friday and especially into the weekend,” Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin told The Independent.
